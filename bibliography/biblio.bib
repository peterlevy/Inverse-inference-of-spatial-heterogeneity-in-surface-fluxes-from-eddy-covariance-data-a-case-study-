  abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.06.047},
  abstract = {Chamber method is commonly used to measure the CO(2) exchange from plant communities. Due to low time resolution, actual measurements reflect only momentary CO(2) exchange rates. Therefore, a common way to derive seasonal or annual estimates is to establish models describing the response of CO(2) exchange to environmental variables, and then to reconstruct the CO(2) exchange over the desired time period. There are several alternative ways to obtain the CO(2) balance for the entire mire: models can be parameterized by individual sample plots, plant communities or the entire site. Similarly, the CO(2) balance can be reconstructed by plots, plant communities or the entire site. We tested how the choice of the modelling and reconstruction approach influences the CO(2) exchange estimates for the entire mire and for individual sample plots and plant communities. We measured the CO(2) exchange in a spatially heterogeneous sedge-dominated northern aapa mire for two growing seasons. We observed high spatial variation in CO(2) balance between the plant communities. We noticed that when the CO(2) balances of individual sample plots or plant communities are of interest, using a model appropriate for the entire site may result in biased estimates. In worst case the different modelling approaches may turn the CO(2) balance of an individual sample plot from positive to negative. Further, while using the whole ecosystem approach in modelling, the superior ability of chamber method in acknowledging spatial variation is lost. While the modelled growing season CO(2) balance of the mire ranged from 232 to 625 g CO(2) m(-2) depending on the chosen modelling and reconstruction approach, the average estimates still remained within the uncertainty range of one another. Acknowledgement of the spatial variation in plant community level makes the areal estimate more robust to varying weather conditions. Further, the reliability of estimates is improved by explicit formulation of the choices behind the modelling and reconstruction units reflecting the study objectives. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  volume = {6},
  issn = {1726-4170},
  abstract = {Peatlands accumulated large carbon (C) stocks as peat in historical times. Currently however, many peatlands are on the verge of becoming sources with their C sequestration function becoming sensitive to environmental changes such as increases in temperature, decreasing water table and enhanced nitrogen deposition. Long term changes in vegetation composition are both, a consequence and indicator of future changes in C sequestration. Spatial continuous accurate assessment of the vegetation composition is a current challenge in keeping a close watch on peatland vegetation changes. In this study we quantified the fractional cover of three major plant functional types (PFTs; Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, and ericoid shrubs) in peatlands, using field spectroscopy reflectance measurements (400-2400 nm) on 25 plots differing in PFT cover. The data was validated using point intercept methodology on the same plots. Our results showed that the detection of open Sphagnum versus Sphagnum covered by vascular plants (shrubs and graminoids) is feasible with an R(2) of 0.81. On the other hand, the partitioning of the vascular plant fraction into shrubs and graminoids revealed lower correlations of R(2) of 0.54 and 0.57, respectively. This study was based on a dataset where the reflectance of all main PFTs and their pure components within the peatland was measured at local spatial scales. Spectrally measured species or plant community abundances can further be used to bridge scaling gaps up to canopy scale, ultimately allowing upscaling of the C balance of peatlands to the ecosystem level.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.029},
  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the floristic composition of northern peatlands provides important information regarding ecosystem processes and their responses to environmental change. Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AEA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82\% and more than 96\% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r(val)(2) = 0.74, 0.45 and 030 for the first three ordination axes and r(val)(2) = 0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PVC is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped. The resultant mapped floristic gradients enabled visualisation of homogeneous vegetation stands, heterogeneous mixtures of different key species and PFTs, and the presence of continuous and abrupt floristic transitions, without the need for unique spectral signatures or the collection of data characterising ancillary environmental variables.

  abstract = {The eddy covariance technique ascertains the exchange rate of CO2 across the interface between the atmosphere and a plant canopy by measuring the covariance between fluctuations in vertical wind velocity and CO2 mixing ratio. Two decades ago, the method was employed to study CO2 exchange of agricultural crops under ideal conditions during short field campaigns. During the past decade the eddy covariance method has emerged as an important tool for evaluating fluxes of carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere over the course of a year, and more. At present, the method is being applied in a nearly continuous mode to study carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange at over a hundred and eighty field sites, worldwide. The objective of this review is to assess the eddy covariance method as it is being applied by the global change community on increasingly longer time scales and over less than ideal surfaces.The eddy covariance method is most accurate when the atmospheric conditions (wind, temperature, humidity, CO2 ) are steady, the underlying vegetation is homogeneous and it is situated on flat terrain for an extended distance upwind. When the eddy covariance method is applied over natural and complex landscapes or during atmospheric conditions that vary with time, the quantification of CO2 exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere must include measurements of atmospheric storage, flux divergence and advection.Averaging CO2 flux measurements over long periods (days to year) reduces random sampling error to relatively small values. Unfortunately, data gaps are inevitable when constructing long data records. Data gaps are generally filled with values produced from statistical and empirical models to produce daily and annual sums of CO2 exchange. Filling data gaps with empirical estimates do not introduce significant bias errors because the empirical algorithms are derived from large statistical populations. On the other hand, flux measurement errors can be biased at night when winds are light and intermittent. Nighttime bias errors tend to produce an underestimate in the measurement of ecosystem respiration.Despite the sources of errors associated with long-term eddy flux measurements, many investigators are producing defensible estimates of annual carbon exchange. When measurements come from nearly ideal sites the error bound on the net annual exchange of CO2 is less than +/-50 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Additional confidence in long-term measurements is growing because investigators are producing values of net ecosystem productivity that are converging with independent values produced by measuring changes in biomass and soil carbon, as long as the biomass inventory studies are conducted over multiple years.},

  abstract = {Sampling errors in eddy correlation flux measurements arise from the small number of large eddies that dominate the flux during typical sampling periods. Several methods to estimate sampling, or random error in flux measurements, have been published. These methods are compared to a more statistically rigorous method which calculates the variance of a covariance when the two variables in the covariance are auto- and cross-correlated. Comparisons are offered between the various methods. Compared to previously published methods, error estimates from this technique were 20 to 25\% higher because of the incorporation of additional terms in the estimate of the variance. This new approach is then applied to define the random error component of representative eddy correlation flux measurements of momentum, sensible and latent heat, carbon dioxide, and ozone from five field studies, three over agricultural crops (corn, soybean, and pasture), and two from towers over forests (deciduous and mixed). The mean normalized error for each type of flux measurement over the five studies ranged from 12\% for sensible heat flux to 31\% for ozone flux. There were not large or significant differences between random errors for fluxes measured over crops versus those measured over forests. The effects of stability, flux magnitude, and wind speed on measurement error are discussed.},

  abstract = {The focus of this work is to investigate and apply the remote sensing method of objectbased image analysis (OBIA) for vegetation classification of a permafrost underlain peatland in sub-arctic Sweden, by using aerial imagery of high resolution. Since the northern landscapes are an important source of naturally stored CH4 and CO2, their contribution to the global carbon cycle is a focus in research about climate change and the global methane exchange. Climate change affects permafrost soils by future increases in the mean temperature and precipitation. It further influences the depth of the frozen layer, and the thickness of the active layer above permafrost increases. This complex relationship results into a changing future landscape distribution of the vegetation at permafrost peatlands. The change has an effect on the exchange of CH4 in particular permafrost areas. For that reason, knowledge about the vegetation distribution of plant communities is interesting for ecological studies. In this work, the observed area is Stordalen mire, which is situated in Swedish Lapland. At this peatland, a landscape change is currently visible as it occurs as variations in the vegetation pattern above the permafrost and by an obvious permafrost thaw. A number of studies focus on the mire and the place has a long history of research in climate change. So far, there is no detailed vegetation map of Stordalen available, indicating the relative spatial distribution of vegetation. Therefore, the main aim is to use a suitable technique to derive a detailed vegetation map by supervised classification. To carry out the information needed, digital aerial photography of high spatial resolution was used. The extraction of thematic information from that data was done by a combination of OBIA methods. Remote sensing has the capability to explore distant regions, and the usage of digital aerial imagery of high resolution allowed to captures the small size of structures of vegetation. It was possible to identify single plant communities from the data, and this information was taken out as vegetation classes. The presented work includes the preprocessing of the data, the segmentation of image objects, establishment of classification controls, set up of training areas, and the image classification to the vegetation map, finally with an evaluation of the results. The resulted map is a contribution to apply OBIA as a method for landscape analysis in future research about northern peatlands.},

  doi = {10.1111/ejss.12432},
  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a greenhouse gas produced mainly by the microbial breakdown of agricultural fertilizer. `Emission factors' (EFs, the fraction of nitrogen added that is released as N2O) are based on flux chamber measurements following the application of fertilizer. These measurements are very variable in space and time so that EFs are often uncertain, but this is rarely quantified. We developed a method that simplifies the calculation of EFs, incorporates prior knowledge and quantifies the uncertainty with a Bayesian approach to fit the parameters of a lognormal model. We compared this with the standard method for interpolating, extrapolating and integrating fluxes of N2O (trapezoidal integration). We verified both methods against process-based model output where the true integral was known and against eddy covariance data where the integral was estimated more accurately because of the greater spatial and temporal coverage. We used the process-based model to simulate flux chamber data and added a lognormal spatial distribution to the model output. The lognormal model performed better than the standard method, in terms of estimating the true underlying cumulative flux more accurately. Estimates based on chamber and eddy covariance data were sometimes substantially different, but with no clear systematic bias. The Bayesian approach with the lognormal model enabled us to combine both chamber and eddy covariance data to constrain cumulative fluxes. The standard trapezoidal method typically underestimates emission factors to some extent if fluxes are lognormally distributed in space. The Bayesian approach with the lognormal model is a robust method for quantifying the uncertainty in cumulative fluxes of N2O. Highlights * Emission factors for N2O are based on sparse and variable measurements, and so are uncertain. * We use a Bayesian approach to simplify the calculation and quantify the uncertainty. * No observed systematic difference between eddy covariance and chamber measurement methods. * The standard trapezoidal method will typically underestimate emission factors.},

  abstract = {Intensively managed grazed grasslands in temperate climates are globally important environments for the exchange of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). We assessed the N and C budget of a mostly grazed, occasionally cut, and fertilized grassland in SE Scotland by measuring or modelling all relevant imports and exports to the field as well as changes in soil C and N pools over time. The N budget was dominated by import from inorganic and organic fertilisers (21.9\,g\,N\,m2\,yr-1) and losses from leaching (5.3\,g\,N\,m2\,yr-1), N2 emissions and NOx and NH3 volatilisation (6.4\,g\,N\,m2\,yr-1). The efficiency of N use by animal products (meat and wool) averaged 11\,\%. On average over nine years (2002\textendash{}2010) the balance of N fluxes suggested that 7.2\,$\pm$\,4.6\,g\,N\,m-2\,y-1 (mean\,$\pm$\,confidence interval at p\,$>$\,0.95) were stored in the soil. The largest component of the C budget was the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE), at an average uptake rate of 218\,$\pm$\,155\,g\,C\,m-2\,y-1 over the nine years. This sink strength was offset by carbon export from the field mainly as harvest (48.9\,g\,C\,m2\,yr-1) and leaching (16.4\,g\,C\,m2\,yr-1). The other export terms, CH4 emissions from the soil, manure applications and enteric fermentation were negligible and only contributed to 0.02\textendash{}4.2\,\% of the total C losses. Only a small fraction of C was incorporated into the body of the grazing animals. Inclusion of these C losses in the budget resulted in a C sink strength of 163\,$\pm$\,140\,g\,C\,m-2\,y-1. On the contrary, soil stock measurements taken in May 2004 and May 2011 indicated that the grassland sequestered N in the 0\textendash{}60\,cm soil layer at 4.51\,$\pm$\,2.64\,g\,N\,m-2\,y-1 and lost C at a rate of 29.08\,$\pm$\,38.19\,g\,C\,m-2\,y-1, respectively. Potential reasons for the discrepancy between these estimates are probably an underestimation of C and N losses, especially from leaching fluxes as well as from animal respiration. The average greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of the grassland was -366\,$\pm$\,601\,g\,CO2\,eq\,m-2\,y-1 and strongly affected by CH4 and N2O emissions. The GHG sink strength of the NEE was reduced by 54\,\% by CH4 and N2O emissions. Enteric fermentation from the ruminating sheep proved to be an important CH4 source, exceeding the contribution of N2O to the GHG budget in some years.},

  abstract = {Experience of long term flux measurements over tall canopiesduring the last two decades has revealed that the eddy flux of sensible plus latentheat is typically 30\% smaller than the available radiant energy flux. This failureto close the energy balance is less common close to the surface over short roughnessbut is still sometimes seen, especially in complex topography. These observationscast doubt on the results obtained from long term flux studies where daily and annualnet ecosystem exchange is usually the small difference between large positive andnegative fluxes over 24 h. In this paper we investigate this problem by examiningsome fundamental assumptions entailed in analysis of surface exchange by the eddyflux method.In particular, we clarify the form and use of the scalar conservation equation thatunderlies this analysis and we examine the links between averaging period androtation of coordinates in the situation where coordinates are aligned with thewind vector. We show that rotating coordinates so that the x axis is alignedwith the mean wind vector has the effect of high pass filtering the scalar covariance,\textasciimacron{}wc, such that contributions to the aerodynamic flux from atmosphericmotions with periods longer than the averaging period are lost while those of shorterperiod are distorted.We compare the effect of computing surface exchange by averaging many shortperiods, in each of which the coordinates are rotated so that the mean verticalvelocity is zero (the method currently adopted in most long-term flux studies),with analysis in long-term coordinates and show a systematic underestimationof surface exchange in the former case. This is illustrated with data from threelong-term forest field sites where underestimations of sensible and latent heatfluxes of 10\textendash{}15\% averaged over many days are seen.Crucial factors determining the loss of flux are the averaging period T, themeasurement height and the content of the scalar cospectrum at periods longerthan T. The properties of this cospectrum over tall canopies in both homogeneousand complex terrain are illustrated by measurements at our three sites and we see thatover tall canopies on flat ground in convectiveconditions, or on hilly sites in near neutralflow, the scalar cospectra have much more low frequency contentthan classical surface-layerspectral forms would predict. We believe that the filtering of this low frequencycovariance by the averaging-rotation operations in common use is a large contributoryfactor to the failure to close the energy balance over tall canopies.},

  abstract = {How to interpret meteorological measurements made at a given level over a surface with regard to characteristic properties such as roughness, albedo, heat, moisture, carbon dioxide, and other gases is an old question which goes back to the very beginnings of modern micrometeorology. It is made even more challenging when it is unclear whether these measurements are only valid for this point/region and precisely describe the conditions there, or if they are also influenced by surrounding areas. After 50 years of field experiments, it has become both apparent and problematic that meteorological measurements are influenced from surfaces on the windward side. As such, extending these measurements for inhomogeneous experimental sites requires a quantitative understanding of these influences. When combined with atmospheric transport models similar to air pollution models, the `footprint' concept \textendash{} a fundamental approach introduced roughly 20 years ago \textendash{} provides us with information on whether or not the condition of upwind site homogeneity is fulfilled. Since these first models, the development of more scientifically based versions, validation experiments and applications has advanced rapidly. The aim of this book is to provide an overview of these developments, to analyze present deficits, to describe applications and to advance this topic at the forefront of micrometeorological research.},

An overview is given of the contributing uncertainties and their magnitude. The relative and absolute uncertainty of a 30min EC flux are estimated for CH4 and N2O using N=2185 EC fluxes. The average absolute uncertainty and its standard deviation are 500$\pm$400ng Cm-2s-1 for CH4 and 100$\pm$100ng Nm-2s-1 for N2O. The corresponding relative uncertainties have 95\% confidence interval ranging from 20\% to 300\% for CH4 and from 30\% to 1800\% for N2O. The large relative uncertainties correspond to relatively small EC fluxes. The uncertainties are mainly caused by the uncertainty due to one-point sampling which contributes on average more than 90\% to the total uncertainty. The other 10\% includes the uncertainty in the correction algorithm for the systematic errors. The uncertainty in a daily and monthly averaged EC flux are estimated for several flux magnitude ranges. The daily and monthly average uncertainty are smaller than 25\% and 10\% for CH4 and smaller than 50\% and 10\% for N2O, respectively, based on fluxes larger than 100ng Cm-2s-1 and 15ng Nm-2s-1.},

Due to the careful calibration of the gas analyzer applied the measuring system is also suitable for the recording of the atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide on the globally compatible scale (WMO X2006A). The paper reports the results of the first two years of the monitoring program, which is the first of its kind in Central Europe. For the period of July 2015\textendash{}June 2017 the concentration measurements indicate an increasing trend of 0.91 nmol mol-1 year-1 with an average concentration of 330.64 nmol mol-1.

The last term, unaccounted for in previous studies of surface-air exchanges, becomes important over tall vegetation and at times when the vertical gradient of the atmospheric constituent (c\=r-(1/zr)$\int$zr0c\=dz) is large, as is the case with CO2 in forests at night. Experimental evidence is presented to support the postulation that the mass flow component is in large part responsible for the large run-to-run variations in eddy fluxes, the lack of energy balance closure and the apparent low eddy fluxes at night under stable stratifications. Three mechanisms causing the non-zero mean vertical velocity are discussed. Of these, drainage flow on undulating terrain is the most important one for long-term flux observations because only a small terrain slope is needed to trigger its occurrence. It is suggested from the data obtained at a boreal deciduous forest that without proper account of the mass flow component, the assessment of annual uptake of CO2 could be biased significantly towards higher values. It is argued that quantifying the mass flow component is a major challenge facing the micrometeorological community.},

  abstract = {Oilseed rape (OSR, Brassica napus L.) is an important feedstock for biodiesel; hence, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and particularly fertilizer-derived nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions during cultivation must be quantified to assess putative greenhouse gas (GHG) savings, thus creating an urgent and increasing need for such data. Substrates of nitrification [ammonium (NH4)] and denitrification [nitrate (NO3)], the predominant N2O production pathways, were supplied separately and in combination to OSR in a UK field trial aiming to: (i) produce an accurate GHG budget of fertilizer application; (ii) characterize short- to medium-term variation in GHG fluxes; (iii) establish the processes driving N2O emission. Three treatments were applied twice, 1~week apart: ammonium nitrate fertilizer (NH4NO3, 69~kg-N~ha-1) mimicking the farm management, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, 34.4~kg-N~ha-1) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 34.6~kg-N~ha-1). We deployed SkyLine2D for the very first time, a novel automated chamber system to measure CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes at unprecedented high temporal and spatial resolution from OSR. During 3~weeks following the fertilizer application, CH4 fluxes were negligible, but all treatments were a net sink for CO2 (ca. 100~g CO2~m-2). Cumulative N2O emissions (ca. 120~g CO2-eq m-2) from NH4NO3 were significantly greater (P~$<$~0.04) than from NaNO3 (ca. 80~g CO2-eq~m-2), but did not differ from NH4Cl (ca. 100~g CO2-eq~m-2) and reduced the carbon sink of photosynthesis so that OSR was a net GHG source in the fertilizer treatment. Diurnal variation in N2O emissions, peaking in the afternoon, was more strongly associated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) than temperature. This suggests that the supply of carbon (C) from photosynthate may have been the key driver of the observed diurnal pattern in N2O emission and thus should be considered in future process-based models of GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {All eddy-covariance flux measurements are associated with random uncertainties which are a combination of sampling error due to natural variability in turbulence and sensor noise. The former is the principal error for systems where the signal-to-noise ratio of the analyser is high, as is usually the case when measuring fluxes of heat, CO2 or H2O. Where signal is limited, which is often the case for measurements of other trace gases and aerosols, instrument uncertainties dominate. Here, we are applying a consistent approach based on auto- and cross-covariance functions to quantify the total random flux error and the random error due to instrument noise separately. As with previous approaches, the random error quantification assumes that the time lag between wind and concentration measurement is known. However, if combined with commonly used automated methods that identify the individual time lag by looking for the maximum in the cross-covariance function of the two entities, analyser noise additionally leads to a systematic bias in the fluxes. Combining data sets from several analysers and using simulations, we show that the method of time-lag determination becomes increasingly important as the magnitude of the instrument error approaches that of the sampling error. The flux bias can be particularly significant for disjunct data, whereas using a prescribed time lag eliminates these effects (provided the time lag does not fluctuate unduly over time). We also demonstrate that when sampling at higher elevations, where low frequency turbulence dominates and covariance peaks are broader, both the probability and magnitude of bias are magnified. We show that the statistical significance of noisy flux data can be increased (limit of detection can be decreased) by appropriate averaging of individual fluxes, but only if systematic biases are avoided by using a prescribed time lag. Finally, we make recommendations for the analysis and reporting of data with low signal-to-noise and their associated errors.},

Studiesofsurfa- air ?ux play a crucial role in this endeavor. The current paradigm of micrometeorology builds on two premises: (i) that scale separation exists so that the microscale phenomena can be treated more or less in isolation of phenomena occurring at larger scales, and (ii) that these phenomena are in?uenced by the surface to such an extent that ``external factors'' can be ignored. Quantitative studies have been based on the assumption of horizontal homogeneity, which inevitably biases the investigation toward over-idealization of the real world by restricting it to perfectly ?at topography and daytime, fair weather conditions. This bias was noted by John Philip 40 years ago: ``Experimenters attempt to avoid [advection] by working on sites downwind of extensive `homogeneous' areas. Sometimes advection is invoked to explain otherwise inexplicable observations...'' (J. Meteorol. 16, 535).},

  abstract = {Boreal/arctic wetlands are dominated by diverse plant species, which vary in their contribution to CH4 production, oxidation and transport processes. Earlier studies have often lumped the processes all together, which may induce large uncertainties into the results. We present a novel model, which includes three vegetation classes and can be used to simulate CH4 emissions from boreal and arctic treeless wetlands. The model is based on an earlier biogeophysical model, CH4MODwetland. We grouped the vegetation as graminoids, shrubs and Sphagnum and recalibrated the vegetation parameters according to their different CH4 production, oxidation and transport capacities. Then, we used eddy-covariance-based CH4 flux observations from a boreal (Siikaneva) and a subarctic fen (Lompoloj{\"a}nkk{\"a}) in Finland to validate the model. The results showed that the recalibrated model could generally simulate the seasonal patterns of the Finnish wetlands with different plant communities. The comparison between the simulated and measured daily CH4 fluxes resulted in a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.82 with a slope of 1.0 and an intercept of -0.1mgm-2h-1 for the Siikaneva site (n=2249, p$<$0.001) and an R2 of 0.82 with a slope of 1.0 and an intercept of 0.0mgm-2h-1 for the Lompoloj{\"a}nkk{\"a} site (n=1826, p$<$0.001). Compared with the original model, the recalibrated model in this study significantly improved the model efficiency (EF), from -5.5 to 0.8 at the Siikaneva site and from -0.4 to 0.8 at the Lompoloj{\"a}nkk{\"a} site. The simulated annual CH4 emissions ranged from 7 to 24gm-2yr-1, which was consistent with the observations (7\textendash{}22gm-2yr-1). However, there are some discrepancies between the simulated and observed daily CH4 fluxes for the Siikaneva site (RMSE=50.0\%) and the Lompoloj{\"a}nkk{\"a} site (RMSE=47.9\%). Model sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the proportion of the graminoids would significantly increase the CH4 emission levels. Our study demonstrated that the parameterization of the different vegetation processes was important in estimating long-term wetland CH4 emissions.},

This study provides an analysis of how permafrost thawing and subsequent vegetation changes in a sub-Arctic Swedish mire have changed the net exchange of greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 over the past three decades. Images of the mire (ca. 17 ha) and surroundings taken with film sensitive in the visible and the near infrared portion of the spectrum, [i.e. colour infrared (CIR) aerial photographs from 1970 and 2000] were used. The results show that during this period the area covered by hummock vegetation decreased by more than 11\% and became replaced by wet-growing plant communities. The overall net uptake of C in the vegetation and the release of C by heterotrophic respiration might have increased resulting in increases in both the growing season atmospheric CO2 sink function with about 16\% and the CH4 emissions with 22\%. Calculating the flux as CO2 equivalents show that the mire in 2000 has a 47\% greater radiative forcing on the atmosphere using a 100-year time horizon. Northern peatlands in areas with thawing sporadic or discontinuous permafrost are likely to act as larger greenhouse gas sources over the growing season today than a few decades ago because of increased CH4 emissions.},

  abstract = {This study deals with changes in the plant cover and its net carbon sequestration over 30 years on a subarctic Sphagnum-mire with permafrost near Abisko, northernmost Sweden, in relation to climatic variations during the same period. Aerial colour infrared images from 1970 and 2000 were compared to reveal changes in surface structure and vegetation over the whole mire, while the plant populations were studied within a smaller, mainly ombrotrophic part. The results demonstrated two processes, namely (1) that wet sites dominated by graminoids expanded while hummock sites dominated by dwarf shrubs receded, and (2) that on the hummocks lichens expanded while evergreen dwarf shrubs and mosses decreased, both processes creating an instability in the surface structure. A successive degradation of the permafrost is the likely reason for the increase in wet areas, while the changes in the hummock vegetation might have resulted from higher spring temperatures giving rise to an intensified snow melt, exposing the vegetation to frost drought. Because of the vegetation changes, the annual litter input of carbon to the mire has increased slightly, by 4 g m-2 a-1 (7.3\%), over these years while an increased erosion has resulted in a loss of 40\textendash{}80 Mg carbon or 7\textendash{}17 g m-2 a-1 for the entire mire over the same period. As the recalcitrant proportion of the litter has decreased, the decay rate in the acrotelm might be expected to increase in the future.},

  abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions from Arctic tundra are an important feedback to global climate. Currently, modelling and predicting CH4 fluxes at broader scales are limited by the challenge of upscaling plot-scale measurements in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, and by uncertainties regarding key controls of CH4 emissions. In this study, CH4 and CO2 fluxes were measured together with a range of environmental variables and detailed vegetation analysis at four sites spanning 300~km latitude from Barrow to Ivotuk (Alaska). We used multiple regression modelling to identify drivers of CH4 flux, and to examine relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and CH4 fluxes. We found that a highly simplified vegetation classification consisting of just three vegetation types (wet sedge, tussock sedge and other) explained 54\% of the variation in CH4 fluxes across the entire transect, performing almost as well as a more complex model including water table, sedge height and soil moisture (explaining 58\% of the variation in CH4 fluxes). Substantial CH4 emissions were recorded from tussock sedges in locations even when the water table was lower than 40~cm below the surface, demonstrating the importance of plant-mediated transport. We also found no relationship between instantaneous GPP and CH4 fluxes, suggesting that models should be cautious in assuming a direct relationship between primary production and CH4 emissions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of vegetation as an integrator of processes controlling CH4 emissions in Arctic ecosystems, and provide a simplified framework for upscaling plot scale CH4 flux measurements from Arctic ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Lakes and wetlands, common ecosystems of the high northern latitudes, exchange large amounts of the climate-forcing gases methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere. The magnitudes of these fluxes and the processes driving them are still uncertain, particularly for subarctic and Arctic lakes where direct measurements of CH4 and CO2 emissions are often of low temporal resolution and are rarely sustained throughout the entire year.  Using the eddy covariance method, we measured surface\textendash{}atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2 during 2.5~years in a thawed fen and a shallow lake of a subarctic peatland complex. Gas exchange at the fen exhibited the expected seasonality of a subarctic wetland with maximum CH4 emissions and CO2 uptake in summer, as well as low but continuous emissions of CH4 and CO2 throughout the snow-covered winter. The seasonality of lake fluxes differed, with maximum CO2 and CH4 flux rates recorded at spring thaw. During the ice-free seasons, we could identify surface CH4 emissions as mostly ebullition events with a seasonal trend in the magnitude of the release, while a net CO2 flux indicated photosynthetic activity. We found correlations between surface CH4 emissions and surface sediment temperature, as well as between diel CO2 uptake and diel solar input. During spring, the breakdown of thermal stratification following ice thaw triggered the degassing of both CH4 and CO2. This spring burst was observed in 2 consecutive years for both gases, with a large inter-annual variability in the magnitude of the CH4 degassing.  On the annual scale, spring emissions converted the lake from a small CO2 sink to a CO2 source: 80 \% of total annual carbon emissions from the lake were emitted as CO2. The annual total carbon exchange per unit area was highest at the fen, which was an annual sink of carbon with respect to the atmosphere. Continuous respiration during the winter partly counteracted the fen summer sink by accounting for, as both CH4 and CO2, 33 \% of annual carbon exchange. Our study shows (1)~the importance of overturn periods (spring or fall) for the annual CH4 and CO2 emissions of northern lakes, (2)~the significance of lakes as atmospheric carbon sources in subarctic landscapes while fens can be a strong carbon sink, and (3)~the potential for ecosystem-scale eddy covariance measurements to improve the understanding of short-term processes driving lake\textendash{}atmosphere exchange of CH4 and CO2.},

These footprint estimates strongly vary in size, depending on receptor height, atmospheric stability, and surface roughness. Reliable footprint calculations from, e.g., Lagrangian stochastic models or large-eddy simulations are computationally expensive and cannot readily be computed for long-term observational programs. To facilitate more accessible footprint estimates, a scaling procedure is introduced for flux footprint functions over a range of stratifications from convective to stable, and receptor heights ranging from near the surface to the middle of the boundary layer. It is shown that, when applying this scaling procedure, footprint estimates collapse to an ensemble of similar curves. A simple parameterisation for the scaled footprint estimates is presented. This parameterisation accounts for the influence of the roughness length on the footprint and allows for a quick but precise algebraic footprint estimation.},

  abstract = {Flux footprint models are often used for interpretation of flux tower measurements, to estimate position and size of surface source areas, and the relative contribution of passive scalar sources to measured fluxes. Accurate knowledge of footprints is of crucial importance for any upscaling exercises from single site flux measurements to local or regional scale. Hence, footprint models are ultimately also of considerable importance for improved greenhouse gas budgeting. With increasing numbers of flux towers within large monitoring networks such as FluxNet, ICOS (Integrated Carbon Observation System), NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network), or AmeriFlux, and with increasing temporal range of observations from such towers (of the order of decades) and availability of airborne flux measurements, there has been an increasing demand for reliable footprint estimation. Even though several sophisticated footprint models have been developed in recent years, most are still not suitable for application to long time series, due to their high computational demands. Existing fast footprint models, on the other hand, are based on surface layer theory and hence are of restricted validity for real-case applications.  To remedy such shortcomings, we present the two-dimensional parameterisation for Flux Footprint Prediction (FFP), based on a novel scaling approach for the crosswind distribution of the flux footprint and on an improved version of the footprint parameterisation of Kljun et al. (2004b). Compared to the latter, FFP now provides not only the extent but also the width and shape of footprint estimates, and explicit consideration of the effects of the surface roughness length. The footprint parameterisation has been developed and evaluated using simulations of the backward Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model LPDM-B (Kljun et al., 2002). Like LPDM-B, the parameterisation is valid for a broad range of boundary layer conditions and measurement heights over the entire planetary boundary layer. Thus, it can provide footprint estimates for a wide range of real-case applications.  The new footprint parameterisation requires input that can be easily determined from, for example, flux tower measurements or airborne flux data. FFP can be applied to data of long-term monitoring programmes as well as be used for quick footprint estimates in the field, or for designing new sites.},

Quantitative information about the `footprint', i.e., the upwind area most likely to affect a downwind flux measurement at a given height z, is essential when flux measurements from different platforms, particularly airborne ones, are compared. Analytical predictions are evaluated against numerical Lagrangian trajectory simulations which are detailed in a companion paper (Leclerc and Thurtell, 1990). For neutral stability, the structurally simple solutions proposed by Gash (1986) are shown to be capable of satisfactory approximation to numerical simulations over a wide range of heights, zero displacements and roughness lengths. Until more sophisticated practical solutions become available, it is suggested that apparent limitations in the validity of some assumptions underlying the Gash solutions for the case of very large surface roughness (forests) and tentative application of the solutions to cases of small thermal instability be dealt with by semi-empirical adjustment of the ratio of horizontal wind to friction velocity. An upper limit of validity of these solutions for z has yet to be established.},

  abstract = {Abstract The characteristics of turbulence in the surface layer are well understood over spatially homogeneous and smooth surfaces. Current theoretical knowledge is based on measurements over such ?ideal?, flat and homogeneous surfaces. Over heterogeneous surfaces of a patchy nature (e.g. urban areas, mixed agricultural crops, forest etc.) turbulence is subject to considerable spatial variability over a wide range of scales. A ?source area? is defined as the portion of the upstream surface containing the effective sources and sinks contributing to the turbulent exchange processes at a given point in the surface layer. It is noted that the term ?source area? refers to sources and sinks on the surface only and does not consider production or dissipation within the atmosphere. the contributions of surface elements are treated as ?plumes? of heat or vapour or momentum?deficiency. A small?perturbation approach to diffusion theory and a plume?diffusion model are used in a numerical source?area model (SAM) to estimate this region, depending on meteorological scaling parameters and the reference location. This model identifies a ?maximum effect source location? and the upwind, downwind and lateral dimensions of regions containing various levels of the total contributing effect. It accounts for the different source weight of each point on the surface, depending on its position relative to the reference location. Although the source area is not directly measurable, the results of SAM compare favourably with observed effects of changing source areas. A sensitivity test of SAM results and non?linear regression leads to a set of simple equations (mini?SAM) approximating SAM. This short?cut model provides easily obtainable estimates of the source?area dimensions and the relative importance of surface elements for a given measurement of turbulent exchange.},

Based on the analytic dispersion model, a normalized crosswind-integrated footprint is proposed that principally depends on the single variable z/z m , where z is a measure of vertical dispersion from a surface source. The explicit dependence of the crosswind-integrated flux footprint on downwind distance, thermal stability and surface roughness is contained in the dependence of z on these variables. By also calculating the flux footprint with a Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model, it is shown that the normalized flux footprint is insensitive to the analytic model assumption of a self-similar vertical concentration profile.},

  abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

  issn = {1866-3591},
  doi = {10.5194/essd-2016-36},
  abstract = {Eddy covariance data from regional flux networks are direct in situ measurement of carbon, water, and energy fluxes and are of vital importance for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of the the global carbon cycle. FLUXNET links regional networks of eddy covariance sites across the globe to quantify the spatial and temporal variability of fluxes at regional to global scales and to detect emergent ecosystem properties. This study presents an assessment of the representativeness of 5 FLUXNET based on the recently released FLUXNET2015 data set. We present a detailed high resolution analysis of the evolving representativeness of FLUXNET through time. Results provide quantitative insights into the extent that various biomes are sampled by the network of networks, the role of the spatial distribution of the sites on the network scale representativeness at any given time, and how that representativeness has changed through time due to changing operational status and data availability at sites in the network. To realize the full potential of FLUXNET observations for understanding emergent ecosystem 10 properties at regional and global scales, we present an approach for upscaling eddy covariance measurements. Informed by the representativeness of observations at the flux sites in the network, the upscaled data reflects the spatio-temporal dynamics of the carbon cycle captured by the in situ measurements. This study presents a method for optimal use of the rich point measurements from FLUXNET to derive an understanding of upscaled carbon fluxes, which can be routinely updated as new data become available, and direct network expansion by identifying regions poorly sampled by the current network.},

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

  abstract = {Eddy covariance technique to measure CO2, water and energy fluxes between biosphere and atmosphere is widely spread and used in various regional networks. Currently more than 250 eddy covariance sites are active around the world measuring carbon exchange at high temporal resolution for different biomes and climatic conditions. In this paper a new standardized set of corrections is introduced and the uncertainties associated with these corrections are assessed for eight different forest sites in Europe with a total of 12 yearly datasets. The uncertainties introduced on the two components GPP (Gross Primary Production) and TER (Terrestrial Ecosystem Respiration) are also discussed and a quantitative analysis presented. Through a factorial analysis we find that generally, uncertainties by different corrections are additive without interactions and that the heuristic u*-correction introduces the largest uncertainty. The results show that a standardized data processing is needed for an effective comparison across biomes and for underpinning inter-annual variability. The methodology presented in this paper has also been integrated in the European database of the eddy covariance measurements.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo has proven a remarkable empirical success, but only recently have we begun to develop a rigorous under- standing of why it performs so well on difficult problems and how it is best applied in practice. Unfortunately, that understanding is con- fined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any ex- haustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

  volume = {14},
  issn = {1532-4435; 1533-7928/e},
  abstract = {A statistical model or a learning machine is called regular if the map taking a parameter to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher information matrix is always positive definite. If otherwise, it is called singular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC), whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold. Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is asymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the real log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being discovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples, because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution. In the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information criterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior distribution with the inverse temperature 1/logn1/log⁡n1/$\backslash$log n, where nnn is the number of training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for or unrealizable by a statistical model. Since WBIC can be numerically calculated without any information about a true distribution, it is a generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.},

  title = {{Towards Spatial Assessment of Carbon Sequestration in Peatlands: Spectroscopy Based Estimation of Fractional Cover of Three Plant Functional Types}},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {1726-4170},
  abstract = {Peatlands accumulated large carbon (C) stocks as peat in historical times. Currently however, many peatlands are on the verge of becoming sources with their C sequestration function becoming sensitive to environmental changes such as increases in temperature, decreasing water table and enhanced nitrogen deposition. Long term changes in vegetation composition are both, a consequence and indicator of future changes in C sequestration. Spatial continuous accurate assessment of the vegetation composition is a current challenge in keeping a close watch on peatland vegetation changes. In this study we quantified the fractional cover of three major plant functional types (PFTs; Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, and ericoid shrubs) in peatlands, using field spectroscopy reflectance measurements (400-2400 nm) on 25 plots differing in PFT cover. The data was validated using point intercept methodology on the same plots. Our results showed that the detection of open Sphagnum versus Sphagnum covered by vascular plants (shrubs and graminoids) is feasible with an R(2) of 0.81. On the other hand, the partitioning of the vascular plant fraction into shrubs and graminoids revealed lower correlations of R(2) of 0.54 and 0.57, respectively. This study was based on a dataset where the reflectance of all main PFTs and their pure components within the peatland was measured at local spatial scales. Spectrally measured species or plant community abundances can further be used to bridge scaling gaps up to canopy scale, ultimately allowing upscaling of the C balance of peatlands to the ecosystem level.},
