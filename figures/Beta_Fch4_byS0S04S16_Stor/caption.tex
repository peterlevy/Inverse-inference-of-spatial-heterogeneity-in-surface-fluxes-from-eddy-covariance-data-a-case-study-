\label{fig:Beta_Fch4_byS0S04S16_Stor} Posterior distributions
of the \(\beta\) coefficients describing the response of methane flux to
windspeed and temperature on water and land, inferred from the flux
tower data using a priori data on the spatial distribution of the two
surface types, and recognising random intercept terms for 1, 4 or 16
spatial regions.
