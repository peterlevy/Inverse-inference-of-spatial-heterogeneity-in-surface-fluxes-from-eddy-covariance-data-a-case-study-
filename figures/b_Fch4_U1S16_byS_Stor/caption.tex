\label{fig:b_Fch4_U1S16_byS_Stor} Posterior distributions of
the random intercept \(b_{s}\) in 16 spatial regions around the flux
tower, estimated without any a priori knowledge of the surface type
classification or its spatial distribution. The regions are
sub-divisions of the four cardinal quadrants in Figure
\ref{fig:Beta_SWI_byS04_Stor}, so the panel layout corresponds to the
spatial configuration, with the tower at the centre (i.e.~top left panel
is furthest NW region). Note that negative values here are relative to
the prediction based on the fixed effects, and do not denote a negative
flux in absolute terms.
