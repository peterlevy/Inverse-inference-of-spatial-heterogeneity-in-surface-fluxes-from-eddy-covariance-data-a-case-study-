\label{fig:Beta_T_Fch4_U5S01_withPrior_Stor} Distributions of
the \(\beta\) temperature coefficient for the five surface types shown
in Figure \ref{fig:r_u5}. The prior distribution is estimated from the
chamber flux data shown in Figure \ref{fig:Fch4vsT_byVeg_ch}. The curves
in red show the posterior distributions which incorporate this chamber
data as a prior. The curves in green show the posterior distributions
based only on the eddy covariance data, using a weakly informative
prior.
