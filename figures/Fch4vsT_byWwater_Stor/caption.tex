\label{fig:Fch4vsT_byWwater_Stor} Relationship between methane
flux and soil temperature, as influenced by the proportion of surface
water in the flux footprint \(W_{water}\) at the Stordalen flux tower.
On land, methane fluxes increase with biological production in the peat,
producing a clear relationship in the green data points, described by
the slope \(\beta_{T_{s}-\mathrm{land}}\). The lake temperature is not
strongly to soil temperature, and lake fluxes are also influenced by
physical turbulence, so there is no strong dependence of \(F_{CH_4}\) on
\(T_s\) in the dark blue points, meaning the slope
\(\beta_{T_{w}-\mathrm{water}}\) is close to zero.
