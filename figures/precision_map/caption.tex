\label{fig:precision_map} Satellite image of the field site
showing the eddy covariance tower (orange triangle) and isopleths of the
flux footprint averaged over the three-year data set (grey lines). The
raster colour scale superimposed on this shows the precision (=
1\(/ \sigma\)) of posterior estimates of the spatial random intercept,
\(b_{s}\) in 16 spatial regions around the flux tower, estimated without
any a priori knowledge of the surface type classification or its spatial
distribution.
