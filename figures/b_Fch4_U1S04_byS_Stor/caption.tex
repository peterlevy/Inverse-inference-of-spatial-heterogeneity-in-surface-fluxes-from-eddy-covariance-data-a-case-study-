\label{fig:b_Fch4_U1S04_byS_Stor} Posterior distributions of
the random intercept \(b_{s}\) in the four cardinal quadrants around the
flux tower, estimated without any \emph{a priori} knowledge of the
surface type classification or its spatial distribution. The panel
layout corresponds to the spatial configuration, with the tower at the
centre. \(b_{s}\) is higher in the all-land quadrants
(\(s_{1}, s_{3}\)), and lower in the water quadrants (\(s_{2}, s_{4}\)).
Note that negative values here are relative to the prediction based on
the fixed effects, and do not denote a negative flux in absolute terms.
