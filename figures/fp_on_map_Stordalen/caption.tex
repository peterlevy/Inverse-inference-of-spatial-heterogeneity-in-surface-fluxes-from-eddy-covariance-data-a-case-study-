\label{fig:fp_on_map_Stordalen} Satellite image of the field
site showing the eddy covariance tower (orange triangle) on the border
of the lake, and the locations of flux chamber measurements (blue
circles). Isopleths of the flux footprint averaged over the three-year
data set are shown, showing the predominant easterly and westerly wind
directions. Gridded lines sub-divide the domain around the tower into a
number (n\(_s\)) nsof regions with which we estimate spatial variability of
the surface flux. Orange lines denote the four cardinal quadrants
(n\(_s\) = 4); Grey lines subdivide these in to further quadrants
(n\(_s\) = 16).
