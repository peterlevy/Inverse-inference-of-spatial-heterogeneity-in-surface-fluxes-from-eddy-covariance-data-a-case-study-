\label{fig:Beta_SWI_byS16_Stor} Posterior distributions of the
slope \(\beta_{G}\) in 16 spatial regions around the flux tower,
estimated without any a priori knowledge of the surface type
classification or its spatial distribution. The regions are
sub-divisions of the four cardinal quadrants in Figure
\ref{fig:Beta_SWI_byS04_Stor}, so the panel layout corresponds to the
spatial configuration, with the tower at the centre (i.e.~top left panel
is furthest NW region). The distributions are narrowly-defined in the
regions where the footprint gives high weightings, and generally yields
the known correct result (high values on land, low values on water). In
regions which are rarely sampled, so with the low footprint weightings,
the distributions are wide, and even the sign of the parameter values is
uncertain (top and bottom rows).
